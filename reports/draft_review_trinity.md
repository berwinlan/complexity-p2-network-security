# Daniel & Becca Draft Review

## Question
I think the question was very clear and the premise made a lot of sense given how relatable the application is. 

## Methodology
The methodology seems very sound and draws heavily from the paper. It's impressive how they are able to use the exact same parameter values from the paper to achieve signficiant results. They also do a great job breaking down every factor and parameter that comes into play for their simulation.


## Results

I think that the results were pretty clear, though I feel like it would be nice if they included actual results from their original paper to show a comparison. 


## Interpretation
I think that the interpretations so far is really interesting and how they delve into how a specific parameter, number of customers, drastically affect infection rate, since size control in a store was an actual measure that was taken during Covid. I wish they would go investigate a bit more on other parameters from their results. 

## Replication
Overall I think they were able to replicate it very well after also reading the actual paper they cited (assuming that it's Fig 2a and 2b in the paper).

## Extension 

Their extension was so fun since it applied it to an actual physical location! I will say they never specified where at Olin so it was a little difficult to understand at first where at Olin this was. 

## Progress
They have some things left to do, but overall they seem to be in a good place.

## Presentation
Well organized & easy to read!

## Mechanics
Everything seems right.
