# Draft Review for Becca and Daniel
## Berwin Lan

**Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?**
This team's modeling question has to do with tweaking different factors in a COVID-19 transmission model for a supermarket. They used an agent-based network, proposed by the paper, and replicated several interventions. I would like to hear a little more about what results we should expect from each intervention, so we know earlier on what's being replicated.

**Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?**
Yes, I understand it, and it makes sense. I am curious what the distribution of random samples is for the pause (uniform distribution)?

**Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?**
I understand, and I think the combination of visual and numerical results is compelling. The figures need to be styled, but the trends look good so far.

**Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?**
The interpretation is great! The argument makes a lot of sense to me, especially because it's pretty intuitive. I'm looking forward to the directed graph results!

**Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?**
I think it would be clearer if images or metrics from the original paper were included earlier (before results from the replication), although they were mentioned in the interpretation. They seem to have replicated the number of infections without intervention (8.23e-9
per day), but there's no reference for the parameter sweeps, although they 

**Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?**
The extension looks like it's in a good place! I'm curious to see how the metrics of Olin differ from the grocery store, and whether you can trace certain changes back to differences in the network structure.

**Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?**
Yep, looking good!

**Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?**
Looks good as well!

**Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?**
Yes!
