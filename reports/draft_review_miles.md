Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

My understanding is that the team is replicating the spread of COVID-19 in supermarkets. I think the explanation is fairly clear and I can generally tell where to go to find the research question, but I think it would be nice to have something like 

#### Research Question: #### How does COVID-19 spread in supermarkets? 

or something like that.

Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

I like the methods and I think they are pretty well labeled. I would like to know some additional details like why face masks are represented by a factor of 0.17 in the model.

Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

I like the heatmap visualization. It would be cool to have an overlay of a supermarket too but that's basically impossible with how NetworkX visualizes things. The line graphs need axes, labels, and tick marks, but I think they capture good information. 

Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

The results are reasonable. I was curious how the team knows, and why, the relationship is quadratically related though.

Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?

It seems like this team came to similar conclusions that their paper came to. Their correspondence is true quantitatively but there is verbal reasoning given too.

Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

I think the extension is fun. It is more specific to our situation at Olin, which makes it an interesting read.

Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

I think the team is probably ahead of where they need to be. They have yet to do a one way aisle layout as of the draft submission, but I imagine they have enough time to do that.

Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guideLinks to an external site.?

As far as I could see, there were no glaring conventional errors in their presentation.

Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?
