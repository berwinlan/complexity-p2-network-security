# Malware Spread in Mobile Networks - Draft Report


## By: Berwin, Trinity, Miles


### Abstract

The paper we decided to choose investigates how malware spreads in mobile tactical networks using an agent-based model. The paper simulates agents within a military network of Platoons that are composed of Squads that move around and interact with other groups. The probability of interaction between different squads are guided by three different movement patterns: random walk, random waypoint, and hierarchical. Based on each agentâ€™s movements, it impact their probability of getting infected by malware. The paper compares the rate of malware spread between these three movement patterns of agents and does a parameter sweep for different malware defense percentages and how fast malware spreads between these 3 different movement patterns with different levels of defense against malware. In their results, they identify that malware took the longest to spread in the random walk movement pattern, while malware spread the quickest in the random waypoint movement pattern. Furthermore, they conducted a parameter sweep on how different levels of fortification against malware impacts the spread of malware, which showed that unless defenses were around 80% there was only a slight slowing of malware spread. Overall, the paper identifies different movement configurations and fortifcation levels to understand at what percentage and what movement resistance to malware is acceptable.

This paper investigates how malware infiltrates mobile tactical networks given different movement patterns and types of security forifications against mobile networks through agent based modelling. The paper highlights how even if different mobile networks may be isolated from others, lack of effective security policies coupled with different types of movement interactions can heavily impact malware spread behavior in the overall system.
